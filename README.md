Besides reading and practicing via the book 'C Primer Plus', the module leader also provides some other assignments and exercise for us to practice, which also enrich my knowledge and on hand experience of C programming.

Please note the the final assignment file only contains two method, indicating my programming sills on linked structures and pointers, the assignment was released at the beginning of 2020, and it was interrupted and cancelled due to Covid-19 Pandamic.
